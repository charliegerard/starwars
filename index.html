          It is a period of civil war.
          Rebel spaceships, striking
          from a hidden base, have won
          their first victory against
          the Evil Galactic Empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the battle, Rebel
          spies managed to steal secret
          plans to the Empire's
          ultimate weapon, the DEATH
          STAR, an armored space
          station with enough power to
          destroy an entire planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pursued by the Empire's
          sinister agents, Princess
          Leia races home aboard her
          starship, custodian of the
          stolen plan that can save
          her people and restore
          freedom to the galaxy....
